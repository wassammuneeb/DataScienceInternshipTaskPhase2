## **Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

In this task, we explored the given dataset to understand its structure and key patterns. The steps included:

* Loading the dataset and checking the first few records.
* Understanding the shape of the data, column names, and data types.
* Identifying missing values and basic data cleaning.
* Generating descriptive statistics for numerical and categorical columns.
* Visualizing the data using simple plots to detect patterns, trends, and anomalies.

The main goal was to get a clear understanding of the dataset before moving forward to modeling.

## **Task 2: Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering**

The second task focused on preparing the dataset for modeling. The steps included:

* Handling missing values by imputing or dropping them.
* Converting categorical variables into numeric form using encoding techniques.
* Scaling numerical features to bring them to a similar range.
* Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
* Creating additional derived features where necessary to improve the model performance.

This task ensured that the data was clean, consistent, and ready for building machine learning models.

## **Task 4: Loan Default Prediction and Threshold Optimization**

In this task, the objective was to predict the likelihood of loan default and optimize the decision threshold based on cost-benefit analysis. The steps included:

* Cleaning and preprocessing the dataset for modeling.
* Training classification models such as Logistic Regression and CatBoost.
* Evaluating model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC score.
* Defining business costs for false positives and false negatives.
* Adjusting the modelâ€™s decision threshold to minimize the total business cost.

This task combined machine learning modeling with practical business considerations for better decision-making.
